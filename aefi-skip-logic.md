## AEFI skip logic
The AEFI skip logic works as follows:
- The 'date immunized' is preset to the last date the client was vaccinated
- The ' immunized for' is set to all the vaccines the client got on the last day of vaccination
- The 'batch number' is set to the batches used on the last day of vaccination

All these fields are automatically disabled. 

>Note: 
>For proper working of the AEFI feature, it is recommended that the AEFI records are added before vaccination of that day
